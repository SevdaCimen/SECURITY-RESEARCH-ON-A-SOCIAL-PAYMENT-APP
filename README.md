Apart from being used only for communication, mobile devices change our
business life, our everyday life and our habits in many areas of our lives.These
changes facilitate our lives and enable us to live a better life.With mobile
apps, it's now possible to do almost anything you can think of.Among them,
mobile payment technologies are taking place.Mobile payment technologies
can also be used to dene the next generation of commerce. Today's consumers
are able to do these transactions with applications that pay with
mobile wallets, gift cards, credit / debt or registered value accounts. "According
to a 2015 study among mobile payment users in the United States,"
20 percent is afraid of basic security concerns about mobile payments, the
likelihood of someone cutting out payment information or other data, and
about 13 percent of their phones being attacked ".ISACA is a non-promote
organization dedicated to the development, adoption and use of globally accepted
knowledge and practices for information systems.ISACA conducted a
comprehensive survey of 2015 mobile payment security specialists with 900
member cyber security experts to investigate the biggest security risks.Only
23 percent of survey respondents said they believe mobile devices are safe
enough to secure personal information, while 47 percent claimed that mobile
payments are not secure.The overwhelming majority expected 87 percent, an
increase in violations of mobile payment data next year 

As a result, when investigations are examined, the safety concerns for
mobile payments are still of great importance and it can be said that the
consumer complaints about the current situation have prevented mass acceptance.
The proliferation of viruses and malware that asect mobile devices,
especially with the real danger of lost or stolen devices, is causing consumer
unease in terms of the reliability of personal information and documents.
There are a few different types of mobile payment systems that all work
a bit differently. Some might require your phone to be near the other device
receiving the payment, like with NFC (near-feld communication) payments,
while others just use the internet.


Most mobile payment systems can be identifed in one of these categories:
1.Everyday Transactions
2.Point of Sale Payments
3.Closed Loop Mobile Payments
4.Carrier Payments
5.Mobile Payment Apps
The Mobile Network Operator provides the necessary infrastructure for
the wireless WAN service. In addition, there are also regulators that are included
in the monitoring of compliance.
There are two types of mobile payment systems between organizations:


1) Remote Payment Systems
On remote mobile payments, the customer request sends a payment request over
a wireless network to the PSP using a remote wireless communication technology


2) Proximity Payment Systems
With proximity mobile payments, the customer usually credits the payment
using a short-range wireless technology. To ensure the safety of the mobile
payment system as a whole, each layer in the mobile payment system
must be resistant to attacks such as man-in-the-middle, replay attacks, or
impersonation attacks.There are several kinds of mobile payment process.
Some of them are physical POS, android share, apple share and samsung
share.Physical POS refers to such things as Apple, Samsung and Android
Pay. The other share applications are the rendering platforms developed
by Google, Apple and Samsung respectively.Even on these platforms there
are some risks. But as days go by, the infrastructure under mobile payments
becomes more robust and naturally can be regarded as completely safe now,
due to most system tokenization. For example, the entrepreneur noted that a
signal could not be attacked using the Samsung Pay icon, the KNOX security
frame, and fingerprint authentication.Existing risks:

{1.Attacks caused by using public Wi-Fi,
{2.Phishing Attacks,
{3.Platform Selection Source Vulnerabilities,
{4.Mobile Malware
{5.Spyware Use.


In terms of reducing these risks, the security of the implementation is in
uenced
by the formation of large demand differences in terms of self-suffciency
and reliability.That's why the PA-DSS standard is available for the development
of mobile payment applications within the scope of some bases.Applications
should avoid scams and provide customers with security in mobile wallets
and payment applications.There are various options to verify the identity
of mobile payments and to secure customer data in the mobile, contactless
world.These are ;

User Solutions
Mobile Payment transactions can be taken by the user by taking the following
factors into consideration.
1.Be sure to implement proper session management in the application.
2.Ensuring that the applications are safe to execute.
3.In practice, all trusted and untrusted (invalid user input, special characters,
for example) conrm the validity of entries.
4.By enforcing the strong authentication mechanism in practice.
5.Using secure web services and Interfaces.
6.In case of loss or theft of the device, in possession


. 2) Hardware Solutions
Some activities can be avoided, such as hardware solutions that can be received
in the mobile device itself and SMS sending without permission.


3)Reseller-Based Solutions
It is an obligation to evaluate the written application in terms of every risk,
to keep up with the current decits and to reach their solutions, to take the
necessary precautions and then to present it to the user.
